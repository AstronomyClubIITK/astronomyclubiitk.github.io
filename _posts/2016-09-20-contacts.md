Adding a contact/member is as simple as adding a new file to specific directory with the name and other details of the person mentioned in it.

We'll go through this process step by step. 

### Step 1
Open the _contacts directory.

<span class="image"><img src="{{site.url}}/postimages/hidden/contacts-1.PNG" alt="" /></span>

### Step 2
Note the existing number of files in it. 
Create a new file.

<span class="image fit"><img src="{{site.url}}/postimages/hidden/contacts-2.PNG" alt="" /></span>

### Step 3
The file name has to be 1 more than the already existing number of contacts (Here 4).

<span class="image"><img src="{{site.url}}/postimages/hidden/contacts-3.PNG" alt="" /></span>

### Step 4

Fill the file with the following contents.

By *omitted* we mean to remove the entire line, including the field.

Observe that there is no *indentation*. It would be better if you keep the structure as it is. 

```
---
name: *Name of the Person - Required*
facebook: *Facebook profile link - This field can be ommitted *
twitter: * Twitter profile link - This field can be omitted *
github: *Github profile link - This field can be ommitted *
img: *img name - This field can be ommitted *
authorid: *Same as file number (here 5)*
mail: *Email Id -  This field can be ommitted *
phone: *Phone number -  This field can be ommitted *
coordinator: *1 if the person is a coordinator - else omit this field (Important)*
secretary: *1 if the person is a secretary - else omit this field (Important)*
---
```

Please note that images have to be uploaded in the images directory in *_contacts* and the file name along with extension should be given in the img field. Try to provide a square image of small size (prefarably < 2MB).

### Step 5
Commit your changes

<span class="image fit"><img src="{{site.url}}/postimages/hidden/contacts-4.PNG" alt="" /></span>


The new contact will be added to contacts list.
