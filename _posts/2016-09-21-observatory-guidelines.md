## Specialized Instructions

### Snake bite: 
+	Call the ambulance immediately and ask the guards for assistance.
+	Emergency first aid
    +	Remain calm and move beyond the snake's striking distance.
    +	Remove jewelry and tight clothing before you start to swell.
    +	Position yourself, if possible, so that the bite is at or below the level of your heart.
    +	Remove shoes if the leg or foot is bitten.
    +	Don't use a tourniquet or apply ice.
    +	Don't cut the wound or attempt to remove the venom.
    +	Don't drink caffeine or alcohol, which could speed the rate at which your body absorbs venom.
    +	Don't try to capture the snake. A snake can actually bite (from a reflex) for several hours even after its dead. Try to remember its color and shape so that you can describe it, which will help in your treatment
