This is a repository for the website of Astronomy club of IIT Kanpur. Its built on jekyll and hosted on github pages. 

This website has been built by writing a lot of code to generate the web pages, in such a way, that subsequent members need not understand the code, and simply wirte a few lines of information regarding the updating the page. For example: If you need to add new contacts to the page, all you write are the name, phone, email and other sloppy details of the new member in a file and upload it. The website automatically adds the new person to the contacts page. 

The project in itself might look over whelming with a large number of files and folders, but they are there to make life easier. It isn't weird once you dive in. So fear not, young padawan, for a little patience you must have, to understand the ways of a jedi master.

You can make edits to the website in two ways.
+ Using github directly
+ Download the repository, make some changes locally, build and test them and push them back up.

#Github
The github method is straight forward, you just open a file and click edit, or add files directly. Post adding/editing a file you'll commit your changes and save. The changes will reflect in the websit in a few seconds. 

# Local Method
In order to build this website on your local computer, you'll need to understand git. It's ok if you don't. There's google for that. 
+ *clone* the repository (If you don't know what this means, do not proceed any further or jump to next section)
+ We'll need to install jekyll on your machine.
  + [Jekyll Install](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for insane people
  + [Jekyll Install for windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/) for sane ones like me
+ In the project root directory, you'll just run 
  `jekyll serve --watch`
+ Open your browser of choice and open [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)
+ Viola! You'll be greeted with the club website.
+ Make changes here and then *commit* and *push*


#What kind of changes do we make?
Hmm I haven't figured out how'll explain.
